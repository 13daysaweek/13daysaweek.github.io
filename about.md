Hello!  My name is Chris House, I'm a Cloud Solution Architect for Microsoft, based in the Twin Cities of Minnesota.  My area of focus is DevOps and Azure services related to application development.  Prior to joining Microsoft, I have worked in a number of roles related to application development, integration and solution architecture.

Outside of work, my interests include fly fishing for trout on the streams of Minnesota and Wisconsin, cooking, brewing mead and spending time with my wife Amy and our three dachshunds.
