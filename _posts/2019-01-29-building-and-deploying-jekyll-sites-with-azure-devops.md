When I decided to get back into blogging after having ditched my previous effort a few years back, I had two initial thoughts.  First, I wanted to take a look at options were available for blogging platforms.  Second, I wanted to start my post off with something more interesting than the obligatory "here's how I built my blog" post.  Well, as of this post, I'm 1 for 2 in those goals as I'm about to run you through how I'm deploying and hosting my shiny new blog using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/" target="_blank">Azure DevOps</a> and <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blob-static-website" target="_blank">Azure Static Website Hosting</a>.
# Hosting Options
Before I retired my previous blog, I was using <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress</a> on a VPS host.  Despite having absolutely zero PHP experience, this worked out pretty well for me.  It was intuitive to setup and easy to configure to meet my fairly minimal needs.  One of my desires with my new blog was to host it on <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft Azure</a>, since my day job involves helping Microsoft's customers build great things on Azure.  It turns out there are two options for running WordPress in Azure.  First, there's an option in the <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/how-to-host-a-scalable-and-optimized-wordpress-for-azure-in-minutes/" target="_blank">Azure Marketplace</a> that provisions WordPress on Azure App Service, Azure Storage and hosted MySQL.  This is a super easy way to get WordPress up and running on top of highly scalable PaaS services.  The other option would be to provision one or more virtual machines and install WordPress and it's dependencies yourself.  There's obviously trade offs to both of these approaches, but for me, since I'm paying for hosting myself, and, let's face it, I'm pretty cheap, both of these options are out of my budget.

Another option I considered is <a href="https://ghost.org/" target="_blank">Ghost</a>.
